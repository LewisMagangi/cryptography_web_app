# Performance Analyzer
# Description: This file contains the functions to analyze the performance of the encryption and decryption algorithms.
# The performance is measured in terms of time taken to encrypt and decrypt the data.
# The performance is measured for the following algorithms:

# Asymmetric Algorithms
# 1. RSA
# 2. ECC
# 3. RSA Key Exchange
# 4. Elliptic Curve Key Exchange
# 5. Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

# Symmetric Algorithms
# 1. Blowfish
# 2. Twofish
# 3. Triple DES

# Hashing & Digital Signatures
# 1. SHA-1
# 2. SHA-256
# 3. SHA-512
# 4. MD5
# 5. HMAC
# 6. Digital Signatures

# Digital Certificates
# 1. Digital Certificates
